# Hubitat Vacation Lighting
An app for the Hubitat Elevation device to simulate lighting activity when away.

## Status
This project is under development. I am learning to develop apps for the Hubitat. This is not yet ready for use.

## Project Goals
This project is designed to provide lighting configurations that randomly turn on and off when you are away from your house. There are apps that do this with mostly random timing. I want this app to give you parameters to be more specific about when certain lights turn on and off.

An example scenario might look like:
* Living room lights should come on between 4 and 5 PM, and go off between 9 and 11 PM.
* Kids bedroom lights can randomly go on and off for 15 minutes at a time throughout the day.
* Master bedroom lights should go on around 7 PM and off between 10 and 11 PM.
